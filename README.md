The file main_demo.html contains a collection of miscellaneous functions 
from our lecture or from lab (based on student questions).

To try these examples out yourself:

1.  Clone or download this repository
2.  Paste your firebase SDK information into the firebase_config_yourname.js file
3.  Rename that file with your name, or teams name, eg. firebase_config_team09.js
4.  Edit all the HTML files so that it sources your renamed config file:
      <script src="./firebase_config_team09.js"> </script>
5.  Eedit main_demo.html
    comment out the functions you are not using;
    only call the ones you are trying out
